Navbar buttons
* Make them work and open new panels that slide in to replace the current Navbar
    * Upgrades
        * Higher chance for loot (20%, increase by 1%)
        * Automatically start over (Include enable button) (Seems OP but tbd)
        * Show better loot (Highlight loot with green border) (I like this but needs inventory done first)
        * Auto sell bad loot
    * Statistics
        * Number of killed enemies
        * Number of times died
        * Total xp received
    * Settings
        * Color themes
        * Rendering stuff?

Inventory
* loot
    * Make loot have a chance to spawn on killing an enemy
    * common, uncommon, rare, epic, elite, legendary, mythic, exotic, ultimate
    * Level 1 probably only have common, uncommon, rare. Add more as you progress
* Equipment
    * Equip the items to make your character better
    * Weapon / offland add attack, or shield add defense?
    * Armor add defense?
    * Ring add crit chance, crit damage, attack per second, etc.
        * Unsure how to add variable attack per second
    * Amulet, accessory same as above. perhaps special abilities? Or more xp, lowered enemy hp

XP
* Add carryover Xp when you level up
* Add progressive overload with leveling up
    * Increase by 25% or so per level
    * Also increase ATK and DEF by 15% or so per level
    * Make enemies drop more XP at higher levels 10% per level? (lower than xp increase tho)

HP
* Same as above. Progressive overload. Make enemies have variable health and gradually increase per level. 

Attack, Defense
* Works for now, but will definitely want more stats for laters. 
* Gradually increase for each level, likey 15-20% per level.

Enemies
* Every 5 or 10 levels, add a Boss.
* Health around 6-8x more than regular enemies.
* ATK and DEF definitely higher too. 2-3x?
* Potentially boss specific items, but that's much later into the game development.
